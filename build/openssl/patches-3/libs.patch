On OmniOS, several libraries have had their functionality moved into libc
but the old libraries persist as stubs for compatibility reasons. Two such
libraries are libdl.so & libpthread.so

There's no specific problem with an application or library linking with these
(just a slight overhead) but when a library is used by a component within
illumos-omnios, a check is made which generates a warning if an
unecessary library is linked.

Openssl is one of the libraries used by illumos-omnios and therefore we
patch the configuration script to stop linking against these two libraries.
